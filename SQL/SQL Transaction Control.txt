# transaction can be viewed as: 1) series of DML, 2) one DDL or DCL

# COMMIT => save changes, erase savepoints,
# implicit: 1) exit SQL+, 2) DDL or DCL issued, 3) autocommit on, 4) user exit SQL*PLUS;


# ROLLBACK => cancel statements not yet committed
# ROLLBACK return to a specified SAVEPOINT (SAVAPOINT A) or last COMMIT (without specified savepoint)

ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT A;
ROLLBACK;

# if single DML is failed, one that statement is executed

# data can only be viewed by current user before COMMIT
